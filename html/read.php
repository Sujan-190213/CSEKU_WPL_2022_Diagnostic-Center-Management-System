    <h1>Late Tahera Akhter
        (CHAIRMAN)</h1>

    <p>After the liberation war, the health sector of Bangladesh was completely deprived due to various political instability and uncertainity. Unfortunately a significant number of people of this country died on that time only because of incomplete diagnosis of disease and lack of better treatment. When the sufferings were beyond the limit, at that time we established Popular Diagnostic Centre Ltd. in Elephant Road, Dhaka. Our goal was to ensure modern treatment facilities for the mass people of the country.

        Popular started its journey in June 1983 and within few days due to its accuracy of the reports and quality of the service Popular became an unparallel symbol of reliability and trust from the end of respective doctors and the people of our country.

    <p>Rx. started its journey as diagnostic centre in June 1983 with a Promise to render the possible standard service to the people of the country at an affordable cost and in turn to limit the outflow of the patient abroad at the expense of heard earn foreign currency. When I started working in pathology department of Dhaka Medical College Hospital, I saw that thousands of people of our country are going to abroad every year only for treatment. The country was losing millions of taka worth foreign currency. That time I felt, as a Doctor I must do something about it. I had the spirit but didn't have the resources. From that inspiration I started Popular Diagnostic.
